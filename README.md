# Riyadh Marathon Analysis

---

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the results of the Riyadh Marathon to gain insights into participant performance and other relevant metrics. The analysis includes data loading, profiling, cleaning, and visualization to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Data Loading
The dataset, which contains the marathon results, is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. This conversion allows for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

## Data Profiling
Data profiling is a comprehensive process of examining the dataset and collecting statistics and information about the data. It helps in understanding the structure, distribution, and quality of the data. Key profiling steps include:
- Displaying basic information about the dataset.
- Viewing the first few rows to get a sense of the data.
- Checking the shape to understand the number of rows and columns.
- Identifying the data types of each column.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning ensures that the dataset is accurate, complete, consistent, relevant, and reliable. The cleaning process involves several steps:

### Handling Missing Values
Missing values can skew the analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions. The dataset is checked for missing values, and appropriate methods, such as imputation or deletion, are applied to handle them.

### Dealing with Outliers
Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern of the data. Detecting and handling outliers is crucial for accurate analysis. Outliers are identified using statistical methods like the z-score and visualization techniques such as box plots.

### Correcting Errors
Any errors in the data, such as incorrect data types or inconsistent formatting, are corrected to ensure the dataset's accuracy.

## Data Visualization
Visualization techniques are used to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. Common visualization methods include:

### Box Plot
A box plot graphically depicts groups of numerical data through their quartiles, highlighting the median and potential outliers.

### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot displays values for two variables for a set of data, showing any correlations or patterns between them.

## Conclusion
The Riyadh Marathon Analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of marathon participants. By examining various metrics and identifying key patterns and anomalies, this analysis helps in understanding participant behavior and performance trends. Further analysis can be conducted to derive more detailed insights and inform decision-making processes related to marathon events.
